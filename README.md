# SocketTest (mej)

Modified version from Akshathkumar Shetty's SocketTest, which can be found here:
[GitHub](https://github.com/akshath/SocketTest)

It has the following features compared to the original SocketTest v 3.0.1:
 * The original Ant project got converted to a Gradle project. The project can be imported to e.g. Eclipse via the Buildship plugin.
 * Print every received text from the connection in a new line and prefix it with `R:`, like it is done for every sent text with `S:`.
 * Allow the user to select a charset like ASCII, UTF-8 or UTF-16 for converting the entered text to raw bytes and back.

## Build JAR
Open a console from your SocketTest project folder and enter:

```console
gradlew build
```

You can find the generated JAR file within the following folder:

```console
SocketTest\build\libs
```
